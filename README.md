# ATtiny-OSCCAL
ATtiny internal oscillator (OSCCAL) runtime calibration for UART Serial

This code originated as an attachment to the paper [AVR054: Run-time calibration of the internal RC oscillator](http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc2563.pdf). It has been adapted to work with ATtiny84 and ATtiny85, along with example Arduino sketches.

The original source can be found by going to the [tinyAVR Microcontrollers Documents](http://www.atmel.com/products/microcontrollers/avr/tinyavr.aspx?tab=documents) page, choosing the "Application Notes" document type from the dropdown menu, and then searching for AVR054. The ZIP file image links to [the code](http://www.atmel.com/images/AVR054.zip).
